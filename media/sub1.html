							<p>Environmental Materials</p>
							<p>Choosing more environmentally preferred fibers and materials is one of the best and most immediate ways
								we can reduce our impacts. We are focused on transitioning our three most highly used
								materials—polyester, leather and cotton - to environmentally preferred options. </p>

							<p>Preferred Cotton</p>
							<p>Cotton is among our top three textiles - a natural fiber that has been used for thousands of years.
								Cotton farming, however, requires vast amounts of water and chemicals. Preferred cotton includes cotton
								that is sourced as Better Cotton, recycled cotton, or organic cotton. </p>
